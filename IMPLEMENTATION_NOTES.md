# AI Renderer - Implementation Notes

## Status: Phase 1 Complete ✓

The vector canvas editor has been successfully implemented and is running at **http://localhost:3000**

## Completed Features (Phase 1)

### ✅ Project Setup
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- React Konva for vector canvas
- Zustand for state management  
- All required dependencies installed

### ✅ Vector Drawing Tools
- **Rectangle Tool** - with adjustable corner radius (0-100px)
- **Circle Tool** - perfect circles with radius control
- **Ellipse Tool** - adjustable radiusX and radiusY
- **Line Tool** - straight lines
- **Bezier Tool** - curved paths with multiple control points
- **Selection Tool** - select, move, resize, rotate shapes
- **Delete Tool** - remove shapes by clicking

### ✅ Drawing Settings Panel
- Stroke color picker with hex input
- Fill color picker with enable/disable toggle
- Stroke width slider (1-20px)
- Corner radius slider (for rectangles, 0-100px)
- All settings apply to new shapes

### ✅ Shape Properties Panel
- Real-time property editing for selected shapes
- Position (X, Y coordinates)
- Size (Width, Height / Radius / RadiusX/Y)
- Rotation angle (0-360°)
- Colors (stroke and fill)
- Stroke width
- Opacity slider
- Layer controls (bring to front, send to back)
- Delete button

### ✅ Canvas Controls
- **Canvas Size Presets**: 512×512, 768×768, 1024×768, 768×1024, 1024×1024
- **Custom Size Inputs**: Manual width and height entry
- **Background Image Upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload
- **Background Opacity**: Slider control (0-100%)
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history management
- **Clear All**: Remove all shapes with confirmation

### ✅ Export & Import
- **Export as PNG**: High-resolution raster export (2x pixel ratio)
- **Export as SVG**: Vector format for editing
- **Export as JSON**: Save complete canvas state
- **Import JSON**: Restore saved canvas projects

### ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` - Redo
- `Delete` or `Backspace` - Delete selected shape
- `Esc` - Deselect shape

### ✅ UI/UX Polish
- Modern, clean interface
- Responsive layout
- Tool icons with labels
- Keyboard shortcut reference bar
- Loading indicator during app initialization
- Shape count display

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Created
- `lib/types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `lib/store/canvas-store.ts` - Zustand state management
- `lib/canvas-export.ts` - Export/import utilities
- `components/canvas/vector-canvas.tsx` - Main canvas component
- `components/canvas/shape-renderer.tsx` - Individual shape rendering
- `components/canvas/drawing-handler.tsx` - Drawing interaction logic
- `components/canvas/drawing-tools.tsx` - Tool selection sidebar
- `components/canvas/shape-properties.tsx` - Properties panel
- `components/canvas/canvas-controls.tsx` - Canvas settings controls
- `components/canvas/export-controls.tsx` - Export buttons
- `components/canvas-app.tsx` - Main app wrapper
- `app/page.tsx` - Next.js page with dynamic loading

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Konva SSR Issue**: Used Next.js dynamic imports with `ssr: false` to load Konva only client-side
2. **Cache Issues**: Configured webpack externals for canvas module
3. **State Management**: Zustand provides efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
4. **History**: Deep cloning shapes for undo/redo to prevent reference issues

## Phase 2: AI Integration (Next Steps)

The following features are planned for Phase 2 but not yet implemented:

### Pending Features
- Google Gemini API integration
- Preview generation (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Final render generation (Gemini 3 Pro / Nano Banana Pro)
- Text-to-image generation
- Image-to-image transformation
- Sketch-to-image (convert vector canvas to realistic image)
- Inpainting with masked areas
- Generation history and gallery
- Cost tracking
- Before/after comparison

### Required for Phase 2
1. Add Google Gemini API key to `.env.local`
2. Create API routes (`app/api/generate/preview/route.ts`, `app/api/generate/final/route.ts`)
3. Build generation control panel
4. Create results gallery component
5. Implement canvas-to-image processing
6. Add cost tracking

## How to Run

1. The dev server is already running at **http://localhost:3000**
2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL
3. Start drawing with the tools on the left
4. Select and edit shapes with the properties panel on the right
5. Export your work using the buttons in the header

## Notes
- All Phase 1 features are complete and functional
- The app is ready for AI integration (Phase 2)
- Environment variables file (`.env.local.example`) is included - rename to `.env.local` and add your API keys when ready for Phase 2
